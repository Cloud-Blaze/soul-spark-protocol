          </h2>

          <ul className="mb-6">
            <li><strong>Cortisol</strong> makes you hyper-efficient but blind to the moment</li>
            <li><strong>Dopamine loops</strong> (scrolling, drinking, gambling) compress time into fake pleasure</li>
            <li><strong>Stress hormones</strong> shrink your ability to form <em>real</em> memories</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep debt</strong> blurs your emotional and temporal anchors</li>
            <li>Your brain stops timestamping moments as <em>significant</em> ‚Äî so it feels like nothing happened</li>
