              <p>When you're locked in infinite scroll, your brain isn't thinkingâ€”it's just surviving.
You're not learning. You're not feeling. You're consuming dopamine instead of creating anything real.</p>

              <p>Every swipe trains your nervous system to chase stimulation instead of meaning.
Every feed refresh costs you a moment you could've spent making art, writing truth, or praying through the fog.</p>

              <p>This isn't just distraction. It's <strong>biological zombification</strong>.</p>

              <p>Around 2012, as apps were optimized for addiction, something broke in society.
The average nervous system was already stressedâ€”and now we were handing it an infinite stream of noise.</p>

              <p>2020 broke us. COVID was the last straw. Now we're all crawling back to the bottleâ€”of dopamine, distraction, denial.</p>

              <p>Unfogged breaks the loop.</p>
