            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In many countries, the long-term neurological impact of alcohol isn't seriously discussed unless someone is in rehab or liver failure.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">But alcohol:</p>
            <ul className="text-lg mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Hijacks GABA/glutamate balance</li>
              <li>Disrupts sleep architecture (especially REM)</li>
              <li>Accelerates B-vitamin depletion (especially B1 and folate)</li>
              <li>Alters cortisol rhythms, leading to chronic stress patterns</li>

              This isn't just "bad drinking habits."

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to realize this: most people never get real nervous system diagnostics.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">Here are just a few things the average person never gets tested:</p>
            <ul className="text-lg mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Cortisol rhythm panel (morning/evening levels)</li>
              <li>Full B-complex panels (B1, B6, B9, B12‚Äînot just B12 alone)</li>
              <li>Omega-3 index (essential for neuron membrane repair)</li>
              <li>CoQ10 or mitochondrial function markers</li>
              <li>HRV (Heart Rate Variability) for vagal tone + stress recovery</li>
              <li>GABA/glutamate ratios (almost never done outside research)</li>
              <li>Magnesium RBC levels (not just serum magnesium)</li>
              <li>Microbiome balance and gut-brain axis inflammation</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Why are these skipped?
              Because most aren't billable, standardized, or available in 10-minute doctor visits.
