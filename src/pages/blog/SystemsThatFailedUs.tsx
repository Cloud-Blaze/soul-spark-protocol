          <p>There's a quiet war most people don't even realize they're in:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>A war for their <strong>nervous system</strong></li>
            <li>A war for their <strong>clarity</strong></li>
            <li>A war for their <strong>autonomy</strong></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>And for decades, millions of us have been fighting on the frontlines‚Äîwithout knowing the battle even started.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">üö® The Real Emergency Is Burnout</h2>
          
          <p>We're not just tired. We're <strong>overstimulated, under-recovered, and biologically rewired</strong> by systems designed to manage symptoms instead of curing root problems.</p>
          
          <p>Big Pharma has turned:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Anxiety into a <strong>lifetime prescription</strong></li>
            <li>Alcohol dependence into a <strong>profitable detox-relapse loop</strong></li>
            <li>Burnout into a <strong>pillable disorder</strong></li>
            <li>Sleep loss into a <strong>melatonin industry</strong></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>And most of us have lived long enough to <strong>become our own guinea pigs.</strong></p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">üß™ We Were Never the Target‚ÄîWe Were the Test</h2>
          
          <p>This is not conspiracy. This is <strong>capitalist inertia.</strong></p>
          
          <p>Pills were made for symptoms.<br />
          But humans are more than symptoms.</p>
          
          <p>We are systems. Nervous systems, endocrine systems, digestive systems‚Äîall connected.</p>
          
          <p>Yet there has never been a <strong>cross-disciplinary protocol</strong> for rebuilding those systems from scratch.<br />
          Until now.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">üåø Unfogged Breaks the Loop</h2>
          
          <p>What happens when people start actually healing?</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>They need fewer prescriptions</li>
            <li>They stop crashing and restarting their lives every 6 months</li>
            <li>They make long-term plans</li>
            <li>They get present enough to fix marriages</li>
            <li>They wake up early again</li>
            <li>They remember who they were <strong>before</strong> the system fogged them</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">üí∞ And That's a Problem‚ÄîFor Them</h2>
          
          <p>This protocol is the enemy of:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Subscription-based pharma profits</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Endless diagnostic labeling</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Codependency on outpatient programs that never end</strong></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Because when nervous systems heal‚Äî<strong>consumers vanish</strong>.</p>
          
          <p>No more chronic symptoms. No more midnight pill refills. No more CPT billing codes for things that were just trauma and exhaustion.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">üß† We Were Never Broken‚ÄîJust Unbalanced</h2>
          
          <p>Unfogged doesn't fix people. It lets people <strong>fix themselves</strong> by resetting the biological rhythms that were hijacked.</p>
          
          <p>And guess what?<br />
          It works.<br />
          Without a single RX.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">üõ†Ô∏è The Age of Nervous System Literacy Has Begun</h2>
          
          <p>The systems that made us sick can't be the ones to make us well.</p>
          
          <p>We need open-source solutions.<br />
          We need cross-functional protocols.<br />
          We need spiritual permission to heal‚Äînot corporate approval.</p>
          
          <p>And most of all:<br />
          We need to remember that <strong>clarity is our birthright‚Äînot a luxury.</strong></p>
          
          <p>This is not just a wellness protocol.<br />
          This is a declaration of independence from the machine.</p>
