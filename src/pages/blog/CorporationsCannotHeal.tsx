            The world we live in?<br />
            It wasn't built for you to be clear.<br />
            It was built for you to <strong>consume</strong>, <strong>comply</strong>, and <strong>stay fogged</strong> just enough to not notice.

            They don't have children.<br />
            They don't cry at night.<br />
            They don't bleed when they're broken.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Because they're not people.<br />

            It's not just about supplements.<br />

            That's why corporations <strong>will never lead this movement</strong>.<br />
